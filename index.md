# What is MPY Blockly?
MPY Blockly is a free visual  programming tools for Micropython on ESP32.By stacking coloured blocks on top of each other a control program can be rapidly generated. 

This simple click’n’drag programming method allows you to rapidly develop control sequences for real life microcontroller projects. This programming method is very similar to Scratch 3.

MPY Blockly also supports standard  'text' programming for those who prefer to use a text editor for programming. 

#### *Micropython*
